    # Attention Is All You Need Paper Summary
    
    ## Section 3.1: Encoder and Decoder Stacks
    
    The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention 
    and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder.
    
    ### Encoder
    The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has 
    two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the 
    second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.
    
    ### Decoder  
    The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition 
    to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third 
    sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack.
    
    ## Section 3.2: Attention
    
    An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value 
    pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.
    
    ### Scaled Dot-Product Attention
    We call our particular attention "Scaled Dot-Product Attention". The input 
    consists of queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv.
    
    Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √dk)V
